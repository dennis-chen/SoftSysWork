a) Where is GLib from and why does it exist?  Who uses it, and for what?  
Would it have been better if they had given it a name less likely to be confused with glibc?

Used by open source projects like GNOME for desktop environments and graphical interfaces. 
Probably would have been a good idea to name it something else. 

b) What are the most important pros and cons of using GLib, as opposed to another library, 
or just using core C features?

Provides data structures with memory management. Provides stuff for multithreaded programming
needed for GUI applications, like mutexes, asynch queues, etc.

c) What do you have to do to compile and run a "Hello GLib" example?
